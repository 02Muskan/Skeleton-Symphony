## ⚡ Perceived Performance Boost

Same load time (~1500ms), *very* different vibes.

- **😬 Without Skeletons**: Content pops in abruptly — feels slow and unpolished.  
- **⚡ With Skeletons**: Instant visual feedback keeps users engaged, makes loading feel smoother.

Skeleton loaders don’t speed up your app — they just make it *feel* faster. And that’s what users remember. 🧠✨
