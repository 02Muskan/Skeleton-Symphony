# **App Name**: Skeleton Symphony

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Skeleton Generation: Dynamically generate skeleton screens for various UI components (cards, tables, etc.) based on component structure and size, including setting timing for when components should appear and disappear.
- Suspense Integration: Use React Suspense and fallback components to manage loading states and display skeleton screens.
- Animation Customization: AI powered tool to generate and customize loader animations using Framer Motion. The tool chooses parameter values appropriate to different styles such as subtle, playful, or dramatic.
- Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading to defer rendering of non-critical components until they are needed, improving initial load time.
- Performance Comparison: Allow users to compare the performance of the UI with and without skeleton screens using built-in performance metrics and visualization tools.
- Tailwind CSS Support: Support integration with Tailwind CSS for styling the skeleton screens and loader animations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of progress and loading.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF) for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A gentle green (#81C784) to indicate completion or positive loading feedback.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and neutral appearance suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use simple, animated icons to represent loading states, such as circular progress bars or pulsating dots.
- Maintain a clean and minimal layout for skeleton screens to avoid distracting users during loading.
- Use smooth and subtle animations for skeleton elements to create a polished loading experience.
